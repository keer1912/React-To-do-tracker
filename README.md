## Features

**Simple Task Management**: The app follows a straightforward structure, allowing you to categorize tasks into **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done**. Quickly move your tasks between these sections as you progress, keeping everything clear and organized.

**Tagging for Organization**: Add custom tags to your tasks for better categorization. Whether it’s work-related, personal, or project-specific, tags allow you to quickly identify the category of your tasks.

**No Clutter**: This app was designed to avoid the clutter found in other task management apps. It's all about **simplicity**. You can focus on your tasks without worrying about extra features, pop-ups, or distractions.

**LocalStorage Saving**: Your tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, ensuring your data persists even after refreshing the page. You won’t need to sign in or worry about losing your progress. The app is lightweight and doesn’t require any backend to function.

**Stay Focused While You Work**: Keep the app on your second monitor or a corner of your screen as you work. With a minimal interface, it's a perfect companion for staying organized without being distracted.

## Technologies Used

This app is built with the following technologies:

- **React.js**: The front-end library that powers the app's interactive user interface. React makes it easy to handle the dynamic state of tasks and categories.
- **LocalStorage**: The tasks are saved using the browser’s local storage, ensuring persistence between page refreshes without the need for a backend server.
- **Tailwind CSS**: An open-source CSS framework used to style the app with a simple, clean, and responsive design.

## How it Works

1. **Create Tasks**: Add tasks by simply typing them into the input field. You can assign them to different categories: **To Do**, **Doing**, or **Done**.
   
2. **Add Tags**: For better organization, you can add custom tags to your tasks. This helps you quickly sort and identify tasks based on their category or subject.
   
3. **Move Tasks**: As you progress with your tasks, move them between **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done** columns to reflect their current state.

4. **Persistent Storage**: The app uses **LocalStorage** to save your tasks. No need for an account or backend. Once you add your tasks, they stay in the app, even after you close or refresh the browser.

5. **Clutter-Free Design**: The interface is simple, with no unnecessary features or distractions, so you can focus solely on your tasks. Keep it open on your second monitor and get straight to work!

## Deployment

The app is deployed on **Netlify**, providing seamless deployment and hosting with a fast, reliable experience.
